# Boundary Conditions:

<p align=justify>
Solving any differential equations requires the specification of boundary conditions. In this section, we will discuss the boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field.
</p>

## Meaning

<p align=justify>Considering two different mediums, medium 1 and medium 2, characterized by the electric permittivities $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$, respectively, and the magnetic permeabilities <math>$\mu_1$</math> and $\mu_2$, respectively, the boundary conditions are the conditions that must be satisfied by the electromagnetic field at the interface between the two mediums.</br>
Solving Maxwell's equations usually envolves solving an equation using Gauss or Stokes' Theorems. Without the definition of boundary conditions, these theorems are not applicable. Therefore, boundary conditions are necessary to solve any electromagnetic problem.</p>
</p>



<p align=justify>
The boundary conditions are usually derived from Poisson's Equation (Eq. 3) and the Condition of Solenoidal Magnetic Flux Density (Eq. 4).
