<h2 align="left" id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
This GitHub repository features a collection of <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> that used to study common and some advanced algorithms used in modern Computational Electromagnetics. The notebook examples are based on two primary books:
<ul>
<il>[1] Anders Bondeson, Thomas Rylander, and Par Ingelstroom's "Computational Electromagnetics", Springer, 2005 - featuring the core and common algorithms,</il>

<il>[2] M. V.K. Chari and S.J. Salon's "Numerical Methods in Electromagnetism" - A great mathematical complement to [1].</il>
</ul>
Three aditional support papers will be used to exemplify the usage of modern computer algorithms and machine learning to solve the problem of parasitic capacitance extraction - a problem that is very important to solve to ensure the reliability of any integrated circuit. <a href="https://python.org/">Python</a> is an open-source scripting language, and a much more powerful programming language than Octave - due to its greater user community, it is also much more versatile. As such, the course's practical notes were converted and adapted to Python. Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks also enables two very useful features: 
<ul>
	<li>The possibility of adding HTML and <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> notes in the middle of code - providing a powerful note-taking system;</li>
	<li>The possibility of running computationally-heavy simulations in the cloud using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a>.</li>
</ul>

	<!-- Add more contributors as needed -->
</ul>

In the case of an issue, me or any other main contributor will open an <a href="https://github.com/das-dias/signal-converters-notebooks/issues">issue-tracking thread</a> for this repository for each of the bugs that are found. Any change that is made to the notes by people interested in collaborating should be done so by generating a new <a href="https://github.com/das-dias/signal-converters-notebooks/pulls">pull request</a> to update the existing notes. The changes will then be reviewed, discussed and approved if they're actually adding value to the notes or correctign existing issues.
